 Can we sneak our dog into the restaurant in our new baby's drawer? Dogs are not allowed in the most restaurants. Sorry, but dogs are not allowed. So we decided to sneak our gorgianolun inside our new baby's drawer. We carefully put our dog in it. We dressed our gorgiannibane, sunglasses, and put a bib on him. Now he looks like a baby. Once Nolan was dressed, we put a blanket to cover his body. It has to work. After that, we headed to the restaurant, 3D Tanger, lunch with our dog. We were about to walk in. If this works, you have to subscribe. We almost entered, but the reception was still in our way. We nervously greeted staff at the reception, just hoping our gorgiann wouldn't get out of baby's drawer. Is baby allowed? Yes sir. Thanks. But, our dog bark!
